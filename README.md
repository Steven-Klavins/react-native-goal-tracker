# React Native Goal Tracker

## My First React Native Application
Add your goal to the list and tap it away once your done, it's simple as that! I created this project as a means to learn React Native basics,  however, here it is. If you're after a simplistic, easy to navigate application to jot down your goals with ease you've found it!

I made this app with the knowledge I obtained from the course [React Native - The Practical Guide - 2020 Edition](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/)
